description: Unified longform video production pipeline — VSL, demo, or tutorial/educational. Script → talking-head avatar (HeyGen) + b-roll + GFX cards + Remotion/HTML slides → finished 16:9 video. Trigger on "make a VSL", "make a longform", "demo video", "tutorial video", "long-form video", "educational video", "walkthrough video".
when-to-use: Use for any longform video (>2 min). Pass `format` to pick the structure — vsl (sales-letter beats: hook→problem→agitation→solution→proof→offer→CTA), demo (product/feature walkthrough, screen-recording-led), or tutorial (step-by-step educational with layered Remotion/HTML visuals).

> ## ⚡ Frame integrity + integrated CTA (MANDATORY — 2026-06-16)
> - **Frame 0 is NEVER black.** The first frame must be a bright money-shot — the cover-freeze of the strongest illustrative beat (Step 10 cover rule). Verify `ffmpeg ... signalstats` → `YAVG > 30`. No black / hook-blank / fade-in opener.
> - **The LAST frame is NEVER black.** The reel must end on content, not a fade-to-black or trailing blank. Verify the final frame `YAVG > 30`.
> - **CTA is integrated by DEFAULT, not optional.** Every reel/VSL ends on a branded **CTA beat baked into the timeline** (offer line + handle/URL), as the final illustrative HyperFrames card. Do not ship a reel whose last beat is filler or black. (In p-reels-split this is the Step 9 CTA takeover; other recipes must add an equivalent closing CTA card.)

> ## ⚡ HyperFrames = illustrative, NOT just titles (MANDATORY — 2026-06-16)
> Every HyperFrames graphics scene MUST pair its title with an **illustrative animation that depicts the point** — never a bare kinetic title card. Examples: a 45-post feed grid staggering in (`back.out`), a count-up stat with day-dots, an animated waveform for "voice", platform chips popping in. Match the premium reference in `cfw-marketing/creatives/productions/restaurants-vsl/hyperframes` (`DIAG-calendar` feed-grid, `HF-*` motion) **and** `cfw-marketing/creatives/productions/fnb-split-screen-short/gen-rich-cards.py`: grid + glow + vignette background, GSAP eased + staggered elements, brand palette, depth (shadows/shine). **Make it as rich and premium as possible — a title-only card is a defect.**

# p-longform — Unified Longform Video Pipeline

Produces one 16:9 (1920×1080) H.264 MP4, 5–20 min, parameterized by `format`. Three formats share a single composite engine (c-ffmpeg) and diverge only in structure, visual layer, and narrative arc.

> **SELF-IMPROVEMENT RULE — READ FIRST:**
> 1. Before executing ANY step, read `LEARNINGS.md` in this same folder (GLOBAL — every brand).
> 1b. **ALSO load the BRAND's production learnings from GBrain** (carried from p-vsl): fetch
>     `mcp__brain-personal__get_page` slug **`projects/<brand>/productions/p-longform`** (disk mirror:
>     `~/Code/Infra/brain-personal/projects/<brand>/productions/p-longform.md`) — this brand's flavor
>     of the recipe + its hard-won fixes. For VSL work also check the legacy slug
>     `projects/<brand>/productions/p-vsl` (pre-2026-06-17 brand learnings live there).
> 2. Apply every item under **Active Feedback** (global) AND every brand learning as non-negotiable rules.
> 3. After completing the task, ask: "How did this go? Any corrections for next time?" Then file by scope:
>    - **Brand-specific** → `put_page` to GBrain `projects/<brand>/productions/p-longform` (append a dated
>      entry; create if missing; dual-write the disk mirror).
>    - **Recipe-level** (every brand) → append to this folder's `LEARNINGS.md`; critical items go under
>      **Active Feedback** with the `[ACTIVE]` prefix.

## Intake — Ask First

Before starting, confirm these three things from the user:

1. **`format`** — `vsl` | `demo` | `tutorial`
2. **`script`** — paste in full, or path to `.txt` (TTS-clean) or `.md` (draft needing approval)
3. **`broll_dir`** — path to an existing b-roll library, screen recordings, or demo captures (optional; say "none" if starting fresh)

Also useful (ask if not obvious from context):
- **`brand`** — brand slug (needed to read brand ref for AI media generation)
- **`production_name`** — folder name under `productions/`
- **`source_video`** — existing green-screen HeyGen render to reuse (skips a new HeyGen job)

---

## Format Parameter Table

| Parameter | Values | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `format` | `vsl` \| `demo` \| `tutorial` | — | Required. Determines narrative structure and visual layers. |
| `script` | path or paste | — | Required. `.txt` = TTS-clean (skip approval); `.md` = draft (show to user first). |
| `broll_dir` | path or `none` | `none` | Library of clips, screenshots, or demo recordings. |
| `source_video` | path or `none` | `none` | Reuse an existing HeyGen green-screen render — skips Step 2. Save credits. |
| `speed` | `1.0`–`1.25` | `1.0` | TTS speed multiplier (ElevenLabs or HeyGen VO). |
| `broll_coverage` | `0%`–`100%` | `80%` | Minimum b-roll coverage target (% of runtime with b-roll over avatar). |
| `num_gfx` | integer | `6` | HTML GFX cards to create (stat reveals, quotes, CTA banners). |
| `num_images` | integer | `4` | AI-generated still images via c-ai-media (supplements GFX). |
| `sfx` | `true` \| `false` | `true` | Mix subtle SFX bed (intro sting, section transitions). |
| `captions` | `true` \| `false` | `false` | Burn word-level captions from SRT (top-center, yellow active word). |
| `remotion` | `true` \| `false` | `false` for vsl/demo; `true` for tutorial | Render Remotion compositions for animated diagram sections. |
| `pip_mode` | `full` \| `corner` \| `none` | `corner` | Avatar layout: `full` = talking-head fills frame; `corner` = PIP bottom-right; `none` = VO only. |

---

## Setup

Read brand path from `~/.gsai/ecosystem.yaml`. Create production folder:

```
{brand_path}/creatives/productions/{production_name}/
  interim/scripts/
  interim/audio/
  interim/broll/segments/
  interim/broll/gfx/
  interim/broll/remotion/
  interim/broll/slides/
  interim/video/base/
  interim/video/compositing/
  final/
```

## Format-Specific Structure

---

### FORMAT: vsl — Sales Letter Video

**Narrative arc:** Hook → Problem → Agitation → Solution → Proof → Offer → CTA

The VSL is the primary conversion tool. Every section maps to a sales beat. Avatar is always present (full-frame or PIP). GFX cards appear on every claim, statistic, and benefit. The script must end with a clear single CTA.

**VSL section map template:**

| Section | Duration | Beat | Visual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hook | 0–30s | Attention-grabbing statement or question | Avatar full-frame, no b-roll |
| Problem | 30s–2m | The pain the viewer is experiencing | Avatar + empathy b-roll |
| Agitation | 2–4m | Consequences of not solving the problem | Avatar + fear/contrast b-roll |
| Solution | 4–8m | Your product/service/methodology | Avatar + product GFX cards |
| Proof | 8–12m | Case studies, testimonials, results | Avatar + stat GFX cards, screenshots |
| Offer | 12–16m | Pricing, bonuses, guarantee | Avatar full-frame + offer GFX |
| CTA | 16–20m | One clear action | Avatar full-frame, CTA card full-screen |

**VSL-specific rules:**
- No numbered chapters or tutorial callouts. Sales copy only.
- Every claim gets a GFX card (stat reveal or quote card). Minimum 1 card per script minute.
- If `num_gfx < 6`, warn the user — a VSL under 6 GFX cards is under-supported.
- CTA must appear on screen as a text card in the final 60 seconds.
- GFX theme: brand dark + accent color (read `brand-ref.md` first). Not tutorial-blue.
- B-roll: lifestyle/aspiration/pain imagery. Screen recordings are wrong for VSL — use c-ai-media or b-roll library.

#### VSL Render Engine (authoritative for `format=vsl` — merged from p-vsl 2026-06-17)

> **This subsection supersedes the standalone `p-vsl` skill** (now deprecated). When `format=vsl`,
> the engine below is the render path — it replaces the generic Step 6 manual b-roll table and the
> Step 7 `pip_mode` global with transcript-synced beat planning + varied per-beat avatar grammar.
> The demo/tutorial formats are unaffected and continue to use the shared pipeline below.

Produces one **1920×1080** H.264 MP4 with a **varied avatar grammar** (the speaker is shown
differently per beat, not one fixed layout), a **transcript-synced background** (b-roll where words
match, HyperFrames motion graphics everywhere else), a **premium SFX + color-grade pass**, a
**first-frame money-shot cover**, and a **per-frame vision-QA gate**. Source is a HeyGen avatar
(default, green-screen) **or** an uploaded real talking-head clip (`source=uploaded`).

**Layout (landscape, PIP bottom-right)** — per `c-ffmpeg/references/landscape-pip.md`:
PIP card `384×330 @ x=1512, y=726`. Graphics templates reserve the bottom band; captions sit in the
lower-left ~76% and never enter the PIP zone.

**VSL engine inputs (beyond the Format Parameter Table):**

| Param | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `source` | No | `heygen` | `heygen` (render green-screen avatar) or `uploaded` (real talking-head clip). |
| `talking_head_video` | If `source=uploaded` | — | Uploaded real clip (face + voice). PIP foreground + audio/duration master. |
| `known_transcript` | No | — | Word-level transcript `[{text,start,end}]`. HeyGen path passes the script → skips Whisper. |
| `broll_coverage_pct` | No | `35` | Transcript-synced b-roll coverage target (rest is HyperFrames). `0` = 100% graphics. |
| `broll_clip_seconds` / `_min` / `_max` | No | `8` / `4` / `12` | Longform beat windows (longer than reels → fewer beats). |

**VSL engine steps (override the generic Step 5V/6/7/8 when `format=vsl`):**

1. **Resolve the avatar source → `AVATAR_SRC` + `SOURCE_KIND`.**
   - `source=heygen` (default): use `source_video` if provided, else render green-screen via
     `c-heygen` (background `#00FF00`, full TTS-clean script). The script IS the transcript →
     pass as `known_transcript`.
   - `source=uploaded`: localize the clip, probe, **silence-detect** (`volumedetect`; mean ~-20 dB =
     real speech, ~-90 dB = STOP and ask for a new source), and **crop flat-white side-bands**
     (left/right ONLY — never the top; the head must not be clipped). Mirror the white-band crop loop
     from `p-reels-split` Step 1.5.

2. **Loudnorm the audio master ONCE → `master.m4a`** (`loudnorm=I=-14:TP=-1.5:LRA=11`). This is the
   ONLY loudnorm — the premium pass (step 7) uses `amix=normalize=0` and never re-normalizes.

3. **Transcribe** with word timestamps (skip if `known_transcript` set). Same fallback chain as
   `p-reels-pip`/`p-reels-split` Step 3 (cfw-transcribe → mlx_whisper → whisper; ≥20%-garbage gate;
   `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` + cached `whisper-large-v3-turbo`). SRT/words JSON is ground truth for all
   b-roll + beat timecodes.

4. **Plan the background beat list with `c-broll-sync`** (`scripts/plan.js`) — places uploaded b-roll
   where the transcript matches and HyperFrames motion graphics everywhere else, gapless. Validate
   gapless coverage; extract `cover_at` (a content beat past the hook for the money-shot).

5. **Avatar-grammar pass (the p-vsl signature).** Tag each beat `full` (avatar-front to camera) /
   `pip` (bottom-right corner over the background) / `hidden` (background fullscreen, voice
   continues). An OPUS planner picks the rhythm; a **deterministic fallback guarantees a valid plan**
   (first beat + last ~12% = `full`; `broll` beats → `hidden`; `graphics` beats → `pip`; never 4+
   identical in a row). **Reserve `full` for sales moments** (hook, key claims, offer, CTA). This
   replaces the single global `pip_mode` — VSL presence is per-beat and varied.

6. **Build the background track + composite per grammar (1920×1080).**
   - `graphics` beats → LOCAL landscape HyperFrames templates (`motion-card-ls.html`,
     `typing-scene-ls.html`, `hook-scene-ls.html`) via `f-hyperframes`/`c-typing-ui`. Every graphics
     scene is **illustrative, not title-only** (see the mandate at the top of this file).
   - `broll` beats → FIT+blurred-fill at 1920×1080. **Screen-recording / app-demo b-roll → apply
     `wowx-motions` (cinematic Ken Burns / camera push) FIRST** (detect by `*screen*`/`*recording*`/`*demo*`/`*app*`/
     `*walkthrough*` or near-zero motion) — flat captures look lifeless held still.
   - Composite each beat by grammar: `hidden` = background only; `full` = keyed avatar (HeyGen:
     two-pass `colorkey=0x00FF00`, zoom-then-crop `scale=2208:1242,crop=1920:1080:144:0` — never
     crop+stretch) or uploaded clip FIT+blurred-fill full-frame; `pip` = background + avatar in the
     bottom-right PIP card (rounded mask). Chroma-key ONLY on the HeyGen path — uploaded opaque clips
     never go through `colorkey`. Concat silent segments, then mux `master.m4a` ONCE.
   - **YAVG brightness gate** (sample t=1, mid, end; YAVG≈0 = black background = build failed —
     fix before continuing).

7. **`c-reel-premium` pass** (Steps P1–P4, landscape): **color grade + SFX always**; kinetic
   captions only when `captions=on` (default off for longform — heavy for 20 min). Use the LOCAL
   landscape templates `caption-overlay-ls.html` + `root-shell-polish-ls.html`; `CAP_TOP=820`,
   captions left of x=1480 (clear the PIP). One pass, `amix=normalize=0` (NEVER re-loudnorm).

8. **First-frame cover** (default on): extract the money-shot frame at `cover_at`, build a 0.4s
   silent freeze (`anullsrc` via `-f lavfi -i`, NEVER `-af`), prepend via re-encoded concat. Keep
   `cover.png` as the thumbnail Output. Frame 0 must be the money-shot, never black.

9. **Tail CTA takeover** (does NOT extend the video) + optional `outro` concat — the video ENDS
   when the speaker ends. Verify the CTA did not extend duration (±0.1s).

10. **Vision-QA gate (non-negotiable).** Extract frames at 3/15/30/45/60/75/90% and **READ each**:
    (a) background not black; (b) `full` beats show the whole face (not cropped/stretched);
    (c) `pip` beats show the PIP card fully on-screen with margin; (d) graphics/captions never cover
    the PIP; (e) background fills the frame (no pillarbox/letterbox/distortion); (f) captions legible
    with brand accent (if on); (g) frame 0 is the money-shot, not black/hook. **Any fail → fix,
    re-render, look again. Never ship a failing VSL.**

**VSL engine gotchas (carried from p-vsl):** audio mastered once (step 2, premium uses
`amix=normalize=0`); output-level seeking (`-i file -ss`) for accurate trims on 5+ min sources;
FIT+blurred-fill for backgrounds + uploaded `full` beats (never bare letterbox); PIP bottom-right
never covered; black background = build failed, never ship it; HyperFrames root = full HTML doc,
strip `<template>` + comments, mapped font names (never `var(--font-*)`), run `lint` + `validate`
before `render`; no `#` comments inside `filter_complex`.

### FORMAT: demo — Product/Feature Walkthrough

**Narrative arc:** Problem statement → Setup → Live demonstration → Result → Next steps

The demo is screen-recording-led. The avatar appears as a PIP (bottom-right or top-right). UI callout overlays highlight key clicks and elements. The viewer should be able to follow along.

**Demo section map template:**

| Section | Duration | Visual |
|---|---|---|
| Context (why this matters) | 0–60s | Avatar full-frame OR screen with voice over |
| Setup / before state | 1–2m | Screen recording + avatar PIP |
| Core demo step 1 | varies | Screen recording, UI callouts, avatar PIP |
| Core demo step N | varies | Screen recording, UI callouts, avatar PIP |
| Result / after state | 1–2m | Screen recording or result screenshots |
| Recap + next steps | 1–2m | Avatar full-frame + summary GFX card |

**Demo-specific rules:**
- Screen recording is the primary visual layer. It drives the timeline — b-roll and GFX are secondary.
- Avatar PIP: bottom-right corner at ~280×280 px (see c-ffmpeg/references/landscape-pip.md for geometry). Never larger — it must not obscure UI.
- UI callouts: use c-html-gfx to generate annotation overlays (arrows, highlight boxes, tooltip labels) as transparent PNGs, composited over the screen recording via c-ffmpeg.
- Trim demo recordings before compositing: cut dead air, mouse drift, loading spinners unless relevant. Use c-ffmpeg trim operations.
- Audio: avatar VO is primary. Screen recording audio is stripped unless a specific sound cue is needed.
- `broll_coverage` applies to screen recording coverage — at minimum 80% of demo sections should show the actual product.

---

### FORMAT: tutorial — Step-by-Step Educational (Visual Composite)

**Narrative arc:** Learning objective → Concept setup → Step-by-step walkthrough → Worked example → Summary + next steps

This is the richest visual format: layered Remotion GFX, HTML explainer slides, demo screen recordings, and optional avatar PIP. Designed for YouTube educational content. This format absorbs the full p-longform-visual pipeline.

**Tutorial section map template (build this before any production):**

| Section | Start | End | Type | Visual Plan |
|---------|-------|-----|------|-------------|
| Intro | 00:00 | 00:30 | talking-head | None — avatar full-frame |
| Concept 1 | 00:30 | 02:00 | concept | Remotion animated diagram |
| Concept 2 | 02:00 | 03:30 | concept | HTML explainer slide |
| Demo | 03:30 | 07:00 | demo-recording | Screen recording, side-by-side |
| Step-by-step | 07:00 | 12:00 | walkthrough | Screen + avatar PIP |
| Summary | 12:00 | 13:00 | talking-head | GFX card: key takeaways |

> Gate: User approves the section map before any rendering starts. The map is the production contract.

**Tutorial visual layers (all built before compositing):**

1. **Remotion GFX** (via f-remotion + c-html-gfx): animated diagrams, stat reveals, step progressions, flow charts. One Remotion composition per `Remotion diagram` section in the map. See Step 3T below.
2. **HTML explainer slides** (via c-html-gfx): progressive reveal slides for conceptual sections. Poppins font, one idea per slide, animated entrance.
3. **Demo screen recordings**: existing recordings from `broll_dir`, or captured fresh. Trim and normalize before compositing.
4. **Avatar PIP** (optional, via c-heygen): talking-head rendered at 1920×1080 green-screen, then composited as PIP (corner or side) over the relevant sections.

**AI-generated broll note (from p-longform-visual LEARNINGS, 2026-05-25):** For fully AI-generated tutorial videos, HTML terminal mockups → Chrome headless screenshots at 1920×1080 are a valid autonomous substitute for screen recordings. Use the freeze-frame approach: PNG → freeze-frame video segment with `ffmpeg -loop 1 -tune stillimage -r 30 -pix_fmt yuv420p`. Map 3–5 screenshots per lesson to script sections.

## Shared Production Pipeline (All Formats)

The steps below use labeled variants (V = vsl, D = demo, T = tutorial) where behavior differs.

---

### Step 1 — Script ⛔ CHECKPOINT

If `script` is a `.md` draft: present to user for review and approval.
If `script` is a `.txt` TTS-clean: confirm word count and estimated duration (`c-script` duration calc).

→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-script/SKILL.md") — TTS preprocessing (remove stage directions, normalize punctuation)
→ Save TTS-clean to: `interim/scripts/{name}-tts.txt`

**Gate: User approves script before any render.**

---

### Step 2 — Avatar Render ⛔ CHECKPOINT

Skip if `source_video` is provided — jump to Step 3.

→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-heygen/SKILL.md") — browser render path
→ Background: `#00FF00` solid (green-screen)
→ Script: full TTS-clean script
→ Voice: brand-configured voice or user-specified

**Gate: User manually triggers HeyGen render and confirms job ID.**

**Reuse principle:** Always prefer `source_video` over a new HeyGen job when the script hasn't changed materially. Never burn HeyGen credits for a layout change.

---

### Step 3 — Poll & Download Avatar

→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-heygen/SKILL.md") — poll via API (60s interval)
→ Download to: `interim/video/base/{name}-green-screen.mp4`
→ Verify green-screen quality (edge color uniformity)

If `speed != 1.0`: apply speed adjust → `interim/video/base/{name}-green-screen-{speed}x.mp4`

---

### Step 4 — Transcription

→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-audio/SKILL.md") — MLX Whisper on downloaded avatar audio (or extracted audio from MP4)
→ Output: `interim/audio/{name}.srt` + `{name}.txt`

The SRT is ground truth for all b-roll timecodes. All segment boundaries in the plan must use SRT timecodes.

---

### Step 5 — Visual Layer Build (format-specific)

#### Step 5V (vsl) — GFX Cards + AI Images

Run in parallel:

**5Va. HTML GFX Cards:**
→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-html-gfx/SKILL.md") — dark studio theme matching brand ref
→ `num_gfx` cards: stat reveals, quote cards, benefit bullets, CTA banner
→ Screenshot to PNG → convert to 5s clips with 1.15x Ken Burns (c-ffmpeg)
→ Output: `interim/broll/gfx/`

**5Vb. AI Images:**
→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-ai-media/SKILL.md") — read `brand-ref.md` first
→ `num_images` lifestyle/aspiration/problem images
→ Output: `{brand_path}/creatives/brolls/images/`

**5Vc. Contextual Background:**
→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-ai-media/SKILL.md") — generate contextual background matching brand/topic
→ Save to: `interim/video/base/{name}-bg.png`

#### Step 5D (demo) — Screen Recording Processing + Callout Overlays

**5Da. Trim screen recordings:**
→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-ffmpeg/SKILL.md") — trim dead air, normalize codec (H.264, 1920×1080, 30fps, no audio)
→ Output: `interim/broll/segments/screen-{section}.mp4`

**5Db. UI callout overlays:**
→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-html-gfx/SKILL.md") — generate transparent PNG annotation overlays per section
→ Arrow annotations, highlight boxes, tooltip labels
→ Output: `interim/broll/gfx/callout-{section}.png`

**5Dc. GFX summary card:**
→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-html-gfx/SKILL.md") — 1 summary/recap GFX card for the final section
→ Output: `interim/broll/gfx/summary-card.mp4`

#### Step 5T (tutorial) — Remotion Compositions + HTML Slides ⛔ CHECKPOINT

**5Ta. Design Remotion compositions:**
For each section marked `Remotion diagram` in the section map:
→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-html-gfx/SKILL.md") —+ f-remotion → design TSX component (Remotion + Tailwind)
→ Composition types: animated diagram, stat reveal, step progression, flow chart
→ Palette: Poppins/Inter fonts, brand colors (dark bg, accent highlight)

> Gate: User approves Remotion composition designs (TSX sketches) before rendering.

**5Tb. Build HTML explainer slides:**
For conceptual sections (not Remotion, not demo):
→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-html-gfx/SKILL.md") — animated explainer slides
→ Rules: progressive reveal, Poppins font, one idea per slide, dark background, animated entrance
→ Output: `interim/broll/slides/slide-{section}.html` + PNG screenshots

**5Tc. Render Remotion:**
→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/f-remotion/SKILL.md") —(via c-html-gfx Remotion render path)
→ Pre-flight: `npm ci --omit=optional` in the Remotion project dir
→ Shared Chromium: `$REMOTION_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` (do not download a second browser)
→ Font gotcha: never use `var(--font-*)` inside `font-family` — the Remotion compiler resolves it literally and falls back to a generic face. Use a mapped name directly: `'Poppins'`, `'Inter'`, `'Oswald'`, `'JetBrains Mono'`.
→ Output: `interim/broll/remotion/{composition}.mp4`

**5Td. Extend GFX clips to section duration (freeze-frame):**
If a Remotion clip is shorter than its section, freeze the last frame for the remainder:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE:-$0}")" && pwd 2>/dev/null)"
[ -d "$SKILL_DIR/.hub" ] || SKILL_DIR="$(find "$HOME/.hermes/skills" "$HOME/.claude/skills" \
   -type d -name p-longform -print 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
ffmpeg -i remotion-clip.mp4 \
  -vf "tpad=stop_mode=clone:stop_duration={extra_seconds}s" \
  -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -y extended-clip.mp4
```

**5Te. AI-generated freeze-frame broll (fully autonomous path):**
When no screen recordings are available, generate HTML terminal mockups or product screenshots → Chrome headless at 1920×1080, then convert to freeze-frame video segments:
```bash
ffmpeg -loop 1 -i screenshot.png -t {section_duration} \
  -tune stillimage -r 30 -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 20 -y freeze-{section}.mp4
```
Concat.txt must be written with `printf`; run `cd "$VIDEO_DIR"` before the ffmpeg concat command so relative paths resolve correctly.

### Step 6 — B-Roll Plan ⛔ CHECKPOINT

→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-broll/SKILL.md") — check library first for reusable assets
→ Use SRT timecodes for all segment boundaries
→ Build the b-roll plan — every row must have:

| Timecode | Speaker Says | Layout | Visual Asset | Zoom |
|---|---|---|---|---|

- Layouts available: `AVATAR_FULL` | `PIP_CORNER` | `PIP_SIDE` | `FULLSCREEN_BROLL` | `SIDE_BY_SIDE`
- Quality guard: ≥4 unique assets, ≥`broll_coverage`% of runtime

**Gate: User reviews and approves b-roll plan before generating assets.**

---

### Step 7 — Composite ⛔ CHECKPOINT

→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-ffmpeg/SKILL.md") — assemble per section map and b-roll plan

**Pre-composite: process avatar background**
Sample avatar edge pixels at a mid frame to detect background type:
- Dominant edge ≈ `#00FF00` → `bg_type=green_screen`: apply two-pass colorkey before scaling
  (`colorkey=0x00FF00:0.25:0.05,colorkey=0x00FF00:0.40:0.01` — use `colorkey`, NOT `chromakey`)
- Anything else → `bg_type=opaque`: skip chroma-key; avatar shows inside PIP card as-is

**For vsl / demo composite (landscape PIP):**
→ Reference: `c-ffmpeg/references/landscape-pip.md`
1. Pre-render: avatar on contextual background → `video/base/avatar-on-bg.mp4` (with `-g 25`)
2. Build segment list per b-roll plan (AVATAR_FULL / PIP / FULLSCREEN)
3. Each segment carries synced audio
4. Concat all segments → `video/compositing/composite-v1.mp4`
5. Verify with ffprobe

**For tutorial composite (section-by-section stitch):**
Assemble per section type in the approved section map:
- `talking-head` sections: avatar video as-is (full-frame)
- `demo-recording` sections: screen recording primary + avatar PIP (if `pip_mode=corner`)
- `concept` sections (Remotion/slides): GFX/slide clip as primary + avatar VO
- `side-by-side` sections: `hstack` or `vstack` of screen + avatar:
  ```bash
  ffmpeg -i main-scaled.mp4 -i demo-trimmed.mp4 \
    -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2[v]" \
    -map "[v]" -map "0:a" -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -y side-by-side.mp4
  ```
→ Output: `video/compositing/composite-v1.mp4`

**Gate: User reviews first composite before post-processing.**

If verify fails: fix and recomposite before proceeding — never carry a broken composite into post.

---

### Step 8 — Post-Processing

**8a. SFX Mix** (if `sfx: true`):
→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-ffmpeg/SKILL.md") — reference `c-ffmpeg/references/audio-processing.md`
→ Check SFX library first for brand intro sting and transition cues
→ Mix at -18 dB moderate (never drown VO)

**8b. Loudness Normalize:**
→ Two-pass loudnorm to **-14 LUFS** (two-pass gets within ±0.5 LUFS on speech TTS)
```bash
# Pass 1 — measure
ffmpeg -i composite.mp4 -af loudnorm=I=-14:LRA=11:TP=-1.5:print_format=json -f null - 2>&1

# Pass 2 — apply with measured values
ffmpeg -i composite.mp4 \
  -af "loudnorm=I=-14:LRA=11:TP=-1.5:measured_I={I}:measured_LRA={LRA}:measured_TP={TP}:measured_thresh={thresh}:linear=true" \
  -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 192k -ar 48000 -ac 2 -y loudnorm.mp4
```

**8c. Captions** (if `captions: true`):
→ Burn word-level captions from SRT → top-center, yellow active word
→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-ffmpeg/SKILL.md") —---

### QA gate (MANDATORY — run before delivery)

Run the shared eval engine (`c-eval-runner`) on the final MP4. It reads this
recipe's `acceptance.json`, delegates the mechanical gate to `c-shorts-qa-gate`,
runs the longform-specific geometry checks, and writes a structured `scorecard.json`.
**Do NOT deliver if it exits non-zero (verdict FAIL).**

```bash
bash .hub/c-eval-runner/scripts/eval-run.sh <FINAL_MP4> --recipe-dir "$SKILL_DIR" --brand "$BRAND_SLUG"
# scorecard → <video_dir>/eval/scorecard.json ; frame sweep → <video_dir>/eval/
```

- **HARD** (verdict FAIL, exit 1, blocks delivery): mechanical gate (loudness ≈ -14
  LUFS, frame-0 brightness YAVG > 30, resolution 1920×1080, fps, audio present),
  duration 300–1200 s, canvas exactly 1920×1080.
- **PERCEPTUAL** (verdict NEEDS_VISION until resolved): the (a)–(k) vision checks are
  emitted as PENDING criteria with a frame sweep — resolve them with a vision pass
  (read the frames or run `c-vision-qa`) and set each pass/fail before delivery.

If a HARD check fails, fix the render and re-run — never deliver a failing gate.
The full checklist lives in `acceptance.json` (the per-recipe spec). A brand may layer
`brand-overrides/<brand-slug>/acceptance.json` to tighten thresholds (same id wins,
new ids appended).

**Interim fail-fast gates (recommended before expensive post-processing steps):**

```bash
bash .hub/c-eval-runner/scripts/eval-run.sh interim/audio/master.m4a \
  --recipe-dir "$SKILL_DIR" --step master_audio          # after Step 2 (VSL engine loudnorm)
bash .hub/c-eval-runner/scripts/eval-run.sh interim/video/compositing/composite-v1.mp4 \
  --recipe-dir "$SKILL_DIR" --step composite             # after Step 7 (composite)
```

See `.hub/c-eval-runner/SKILL.md` for the spec format + built-in check types, and
`cfw-skills-pack/docs/skills-audit.md` §4 for the generic eval architecture.

---

### Step 9 — Delivery ⛔ CHECKPOINT

→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-production/SKILL.md") — run 12-point delivery checklist
→ Final naming: `ls-{category}01-{description}.mp4` → copy to `final/`

**Gate: All 12 checks pass. User reviews final before marking done.**

---

### Step 10 — Archive

→ LOAD: skill_view("p-longform", ".hub/c-broll/SKILL.md") — archive reusable clips from `interim/broll/` to `{brand_path}/creatives/brolls/`
→ Update library `.md` index files
→ Run `/deliver` to mark production complete

---

## Anti-Patterns & Gotchas

**No `#` comments inside ffmpeg `filter_complex` strings** — parse error. Save complex filter graphs to a `.sh` file if they exceed 3 lines.

**Remotion font gotcha:** Never put `var(--font-*)` inside a `font-family` value in a Remotion/HyperFrames component. The Remotion compiler resolves font-family literally — a CSS var falls back to a generic face. Always use a mapped font name: `'Poppins'`, `'Inter'`, `'Oswald'`, `'JetBrains Mono'`.

**Concat.txt path resolution:** Always `cd "$VIDEO_DIR"` before running an ffmpeg concat command with a concat.txt. Relative paths in concat.txt break when the working directory is different. Write the concat.txt with `printf`, not `echo`.

**Freeze-frame segment:** Use `-loop 1 -tune stillimage -r 30 -pix_fmt yuv420p` for PNG-to-video. `-tune stillimage` only applies to H.264 — omit if using another codec.

**Two-pass loudnorm is mandatory for TTS.** A single-pass loudnorm on TTS audio can land 1–2 LU off target. Two-pass gets within ±0.5 LU.

**Never reuse `source_video` from a different script without re-transcribing.** The SRT must match the audio in `source_video`. If you skip HeyGen but use a cached render, run c-audio transcription on the cached MP4, not on the new script text.

**`colorkey` not `chromakey`.** This build's ffmpeg does not have `chromakey`. Use `colorkey=0x00FF00:0.25:0.05` (two-pass: run it twice with slightly different similarity/blend values to clean up fringe).

**Section map is the production contract.** For the tutorial format, the section map is approved by the user before any rendering. Changes to the section map after Step 5T starts require explicit user approval and may invalidate already-rendered Remotion clips.

**Demo audio stripping:** Always strip audio from screen recordings before compositing. The avatar VO is the single audio master. Mixing screen recording audio and avatar VO creates phase and level problems.

**VSL GFX theme ≠ tutorial theme.** VSL GFX cards use brand dark + accent (sales/conversion aesthetic). Tutorial slides use a lighter educational aesthetic. Never copy GFX from one format to the other.

---

## Self-Improvement Feedback Loop

After completing the task:
1. Ask the user: "How did this go? Any corrections or improvements for next time?"
2. Summarize feedback into 1–3 concise bullet points.
3. Append to `LEARNINGS.md` in this folder with today's date.
4. If feedback is critical (affects correctness or quality), add it to the **Active Feedback** section at the top of `LEARNINGS.md` with the `[ACTIVE]` prefix.
